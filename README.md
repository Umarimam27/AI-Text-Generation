# Next-Word-Prediction
Developed a Next Word Prediction system using RNN and Seq2Seq architecture with LSTM in TensorFlow/Keras. The model learns language patterns to predict and generate human-like text. Built an interactive Streamlit web app with real-time text generation, temperature-based sampling, and optimized model loading.
