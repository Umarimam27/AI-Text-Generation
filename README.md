# Next-Word-Prediction
Developed a Next Word Prediction system using RNN and Seq2Seq architecture with LSTM in TensorFlow/Keras. The model learns language patterns to predict and generate human-like text. Built an interactive Streamlit web app with real-time text generation, temperature-based sampling, and optimized model loading.

Next Word Prediction using RNN & Seq2Seq

This project predicts the next word in a sentence using LSTM-based
Seq2Seq models built with TensorFlow and Keras.
The app is deployed using Streamlit for real-time text generation.

Tech: Python, TensorFlow, Keras, RNN, LSTM, Streamlit
